#  ---------------------- Hello -------------------------


# INSTRUCTIONS
#
# In this program, you must ask the user:
#	"What is your name?"
#
# And then respond by printing out a personalized greeting.


# GENERAL RULE
#
# For a person named Maria, respond by printing:
#	Hello Maria :)
#
# For a person named Wally, respond by printing:
#	Hello Wally :)
#
# ...etc.
#
# In general, for a person named <NAME>, respond by printing:
#	Hello <NAME>


# SPECIAL NAMES
#
# Two people are special: Amar and Brandy. 
# A person named Amar or Brandy should receive an additional comment after you say hello
#
# For a person named Amar, respond by saying:
#	Hello Amar :)
#	I like your shoes
#
# For a person named Brandy, respond by saying:
#	Hello Brandy :)
#	You seem like a cool person


# Note that the robot grader will only mark your solution correct if your
# print statements match EXACTLY what was specified above.
#	
#	Spelling, spacing, punctuation... all that stuff matters.
#
#	Your input statement also matters. You must say it exactly like this: 
#		What is your name?


# --------------------------------------------------------------------


# Put your Python code here:

#This code greets people and then asks subsequent questions

message = "What is your name?"

print(message)


#This is the more efficient way to allow user input and prompt for their name.
	The Prompt will disappear when the user enters their name.

#STANDARD REPLY
name = input("What is your name?")
print ("Hello", name)

#SPECIAL REPLY
name = input ("What is your name?")
if (name = "Amar","amar") then print("Hello Amar :)\n I like your shoes") 
ifel name= "Brandy" or "brandy" print ("Hello Brandy Hello Brandy :)\nYou seem like a cool person")
else= print("Hello",name)
