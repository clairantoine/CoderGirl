#Notes- 3.13.19#

forloop- known number of times to run a loop

parts of the for loop:
declaration; condition; statement modifying variable.

Nested example:

for(int x= 0; x< 10; x++)
{
for(int y=0; y<8; y++)
}
dothing

^this example will run 80 times. because top loop causes the 8loop
& "Do thing" to run TEN TIMES.

EXAMPLE 2:
for(int i=0; i< 10; i ++)
	{
	method1();
	for(int y=0; y<5; y++0
		{method2();
		}
	}
	
MARIO EXERCISE:

import java.util.Scanner;

public static void main(String[] args)
{
System.out.print ("How many levels?");
int height = keyboard.nextInt();
keyboard.skip("\n");
System.out.print ("")
int counter= 2;

	for(height= 2; <height ; counter++)
	{System.out.print("#");
		for( ; ; )
		{
		
		}
	
	}

}


## GIT ##
fork- take a copy of someone else's remote repository
clone- putting a copy on your computer
commit-
add- prepares a change to be added
push- pushes changes to the repository//
branch(aka feature branch)- makes a copy of your work so
		you (or others)can work on it without changing the master
pull- pulls the updated version of the remote repository
merge- puts it into the master and checks for conflicts

:wq = this is how you get out "Vi", the text editor built into git
	[you installed notepad++, so you don't use Vi]
