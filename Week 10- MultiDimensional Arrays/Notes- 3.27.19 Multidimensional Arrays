## Notes- 3.27.19 ##

-next week only prep work is a survey.
-week after will be a LOT of work (OBJECTS!)

April 10th (Late work has to be submitted and graded).


##Multidimensional Arrays##
they are arrays of arrays
most common use is makeing grids
two boxes means two-dimensional. 3 boxes is 3-dimensional

int[][] arr= new int [3][4] ---> this format is better if you don't know what you want
									int the array. (pulling in data)
			={{1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4} {1,2,3,4}} --->doesn't HAVE to have same amount of integers								


i = iterator
arr [i][0]

if you want to go through more 

outer loop= i
inner loop= k

outer loop gets processed first
each bracket is either a row or column
so whatever VARIABLE is in the left bracket will determine which way you "iterate" first. 
	if I is in the outer loop, it's INNER loop (variable k) will 
	First cookie from every box is to put the COLUMN first. 
	First box, one cookie at a time is to put the ROW first.
	
	
OBJECT- every object can be put into another object.

#Methods#
when deciding on what goes into a method:

-Repeated code means you need a method
-copy/paste means you prolly need a method
A method should DO something.
methods should have one purpose. ONE Task.
making lots of small methods has benefits cuz you're able to change things more easily.

##class exercise##

instantiate scanner IN the method 
OR
pass it through as a PARAMETER of the method itself
	ie. public static int getChoice(Scanner s){
	int choice;
	do {
            System.out.println("How do you want to sign up?");
            System.out.println("1 - Phone Number");
            System.out.println("2 - Email");
            choice = s.nextInt();
            s.skip("\n");
        } while (choice < 1 || choice > 2);

		---->since all we're doing in this method is GETTING their CHOICE, 
			we can initialize the variable IN THE METHOD, rather than passing it
			through as a parameter (which would look like "int choice")
			
			
##TOURNARY Expression#
" and your " + (choice == 1 ? "phone number" : "email address") + " is " + phoneEmail + ".");
